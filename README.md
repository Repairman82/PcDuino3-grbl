# PcDuino3-grbl
My quest to run grbl on a pcduino3b using a cnc shield for a self contained machine.

I'm relatively new to Arduino and programming so please be patient with me as I am learning. I recently acquired a PCduino3b to learn Arduino and programming. I also have several Arduno UNO's that I have been playing with. 

I may be reinventing the wheel here, but I believe it will be worth the time to try this. I will try to get the files uploaded that I am working on soon.
